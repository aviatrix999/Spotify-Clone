# ⚙️ How It Works

## 1️⃣ Song Initialization

The songs are stored inside a JavaScript array containing:

* Song name
* Audio file path
* Cover image path
* Timestamp

```javascript
let songs = [
  {
    songName: "Salvatore",
    filePath: "./assets/songs/1.mp3",
    coverPath: "./assets/cover/1.jpg",
    timeStamp: "4:41",
  }
];
```

---

## 2️⃣ Dynamic Song Rendering

JavaScript dynamically updates:

* Song names
* Cover images
* Timestamps

inside the HTML UI.

---

## 3️⃣ Audio Playback Controls

Users can:

* Play songs
* Pause songs
* Skip forward
* Go back

using event listeners.

---

## 4️⃣ Progress Bar Sync

The progress bar updates automatically as the song plays.

```javascript
audioElement.addEventListener("timeupdate", () => {
  let progress = parseInt(
    (audioElement.currentTime / audioElement.duration) * 100
  );

  myProgressBar.value = progress;
});
```
